## Introduction

Welcome to the **Workout Tracker Backend**, a Spring Boot project designed to help users manage their workouts, track exercises, and monitor weight progress effectively. This backend provides endpoints for authentication, workout routines, exercises, and daily workout plans. It offers secure and robust functionality while maintaining high performance and ease of use.

## Features

- User authentication and authorization using JWT.
- Manage workout routines, days, and exercises.
- Track weights and repetitions for exercises.
- Database integration for persistent data storage.
- Test coverage to ensure code reliability.
- Ready-to-use development environment with Docker.

## Technologies Used

This project is built using the following technologies and tools:

- **Spring Boot**: The core Java framework for building the backend.
- **Hibernate**: ORM for mapping Java objects to relational databases and executing custom SQL queries.
- **Spotless**: A Java linter to ensure code cleanliness and consistency.
- **Spring Security + JWT**: Manages user authentication and authorization, providing secure access to endpoints.
- **WebTestClient + WebFlux**: Reactive programming and testing tools for efficient API validation.
- **MySQL + H2**: Databases for production (MySQL) and testing (H2) environments.
- **Docker**: Containers to create a consistent and isolated development environment.
